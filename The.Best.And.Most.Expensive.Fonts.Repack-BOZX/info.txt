The.Best.And.Most.Expensive.Fonts.1500+.Font.Collection


What sets this one apart from every other font pack you've seen, is that these fonts are absolutely the cream of the crop. Most of these retail at a couple of hundred bucks a piece, which probably puts this whole collection well over the $50,000 mark. This is -- by far -- the most expensive pirated "software" I have in my posession.

The most expensive ones are scene releases by the font group TYPO, while the folder 'Font.Flood-Mixed.Fonts-all.the.world' has 1,276 individual fonts, all neatly separated in categories. Some of the scene releases also include original, retail PDF manuals and interesting goodies.
